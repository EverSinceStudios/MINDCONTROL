Running through a haunted mansion
Entirely dark map layout. With traps and pitfalls throughout. Meant to be scary.
The only usable source of light in each level is the player's torch.
Player character will have no advanced movement capabilities (no jump, dash, or sprint)


torch mechanic
on -> (+) can see the layout of the level and consequently the traps, dangers, and the level exit.
on -> (-) Enemies will chase after you for up to a second after your torch is turned off. 
off -> (-) Can see nothing in the level besides the character themselves and the eyes of any nearby monsters. 
off -> (+) No monster will be aggro'd by the player
Can be turned on/off using the F key. (might limit time that the light torch will remain on)
Light from the torch should illuminate approx. 90% of the level.


traps mechanic
traps will OHKO anything that falls into their trigger area.
they exist in various different forms
- spike pitfall traps (these must be walked into)
- light traps (these are designed to kill the player if they activate their light while standing on a specific tile, usually by attracting a previously hidden monster too close to avoid or run from)
	Example: Light activate an arrow turret that fires an arrow down a hallway. 
- spear wall traps (these will likely be tied to "pressure plates". 


Monster mechanics
aggro active -> will run to the player in a straight line.
Monster eyes will always be visible
Monsters will all walk faster than the player character
Any contact from a monster will be fatal


pace of play
aiming to keep levels fast.
respawn and resetting the level will need to be quick. I want HLM style quickness when it comes to consequtive level run attempts

sounds to get
- monster running (aggroed)
- monster growl (passive)
- player panting (running)
- player crying (idle, scared, after first monster enounter)
- trap activation
- death sounds
- ambient scary tracks
- door opening/closing
- success sound
